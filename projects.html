                <h3>Build-The-Vocabulary</h3>
                <p> 
                    The project was about a glossary of web development and programming-related terms, each followed by a short definition or explanation.
                    The list include terms like API, Async/Await, Attributes and more.The definitions cover key frontend and web development concepts like CSS, DOM, Flexbox, Event Listener, CDN, and Client-Side. 
                    The document spans 112 lines (56 LOC) and is about 4.87 KB in size. It was last updated by a user named charger71, as noted by the commit message “updated task”.
                    Overall, the file serves as a concise reference for fundamental web development terminology. 
                    I later updated the Css file that turns it into a flash card.

                <h3>Python--user-input</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple python project was to demonstarte how to take user input and write to a text file.
                    It prompt the user to enter their name with a message "what's your name?". It then ask for their favorite color.
                    the program creates a file called example.txt. It writes the user's name and favorite color to the file in a formatted way.
